Does PCEM-GMM give a big enough improvement over PCA-GMM to justify the extra computation?

Does power iteration still work well when sample size N is small compared to dimension d?

Does PCEM-GMM handle covariance estimation well when multiple clusters exist?

When to stop based on eigenvalue drop-off?

Which deflation method is better?
```
    projection_matrix = torch.eye(v.shape[0], device=device) - torch.outer(v, v)
    centered_data = centered_data @ projection_matrix  # Project onto hyperplane
```
```
    projection = (centered_data @ v).unsqueeze(1) * v.unsqueeze(0)
    centered_data -= projection  # Deflate the data
```

The document mentions random initialization of the eigenvectors for power iteration, but how about the initial cluster means? Would a more sophisticated initialization scheme, like k-means++, be beneficial?

How sensitive is the algorithm to numerical errors in the deflation step, which might lead to a gradual loss of orthogonality? Would it be worth periodically re-orthogonalizing the eigenvectors (e.g., using Gram-Schmidt)?

While log-likelihood is a standard metric, it can be misleading, especially when comparing models with different complexities. Consider using metrics that penalize model complexity, like AIC or BIC, to get a fairer comparison.

Could PCEM-GMM be adapted to an online learning setting, where data arrives sequentially? 

Could the core idea of iterative covariance construction be extended to other types of distributions (e.g., t-distributions for more robust clustering)?

While the document presents PCEM-GMM as a replacement for pre-processing based dimensionality reduction, I wonder if this iterative building of structure could be combined with a learned representation, like an autoencoder. Perhaps the latent space representation could itself inform the PCEM procedure, and vice versa.

While accuracy and confusion matrices are useful, consider adding the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). ARI is a measure of clustering similarity that corrects for chance. It's particularly useful when comparing clusterings with different numbers of clusters or when the ground truth labels are known.
