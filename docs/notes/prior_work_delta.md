## **1. Comparison with PCA-GMM (Hertrich et al., 2021)**  
**PCA-GMM** incorporates **dimensionality reduction into the Gaussian mixture model** by applying PCA to each cluster. The key aspects of PCA-GMM are:  
- It **first projects data onto a lower-dimensional subspace** determined by PCA.  
- Each Gaussian component in the GMM **operates in its own PCA-reduced space** instead of the full feature space.  
- The **M-step optimizes both the Gaussian parameters and the subspace projection**, meaning that principal components are jointly learned with the mixture model.

### **How PCEM-GMM Differs from PCA-GMM**
‚úÖ **Iterative Principal Component Extraction**:  
- PCEM-GMM **extracts principal components dynamically during EM** rather than **fixing a projection space beforehand**.  
- PCA-GMM applies **a single global PCA transformation per component**, while **PCEM-GMM extracts eigenvectors one at a time**, adapting dynamically.  

‚úÖ **Avoidance of Explicit Covariance Matrices**:  
- PCA-GMM still **stores and uses reduced covariance matrices** in the subspace.  
- PCEM-GMM **never explicitly computes covariance matrices**; instead, it builds them **iteratively using power iteration**.  

‚úÖ **Better Handling of High Dimensions**:  
- PCA-GMM **reduces dimensions first**, then fits GMMs in that space.  
- PCEM-GMM **builds covariance structures incrementally**, allowing it to work in settings where dimensionality reduction would typically distort the data.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
**PCA-GMM and PCEM-GMM both integrate PCA into the GMM training process, but PCEM-GMM does so dynamically within the EM loop instead of as a preprocessing step.** PCA-GMM‚Äôs subspace is predetermined at each step, whereas PCEM-GMM **discovers covariance structure iteratively**.

## **2. Comparison with Mixtures of Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) (Tipping & Bishop, 1999)**  
Mixtures of PPCA assume that each Gaussian component lies in a **low-rank subspace** rather than a full-dimensional space.  
- Each mixture component‚Äôs covariance matrix is modeled as:  
  \[
  \Sigma_k = W_k W_k^T + \sigma^2 I
  \]
  where \( W_k \) is a **low-rank factor loading matrix** (a form of principal component projection).  
- The **EM algorithm learns both the mixture model and the principal subspaces** simultaneously.  

### **How PCEM-GMM Differs from Mixtures of PPCA**
‚úÖ **No Explicit Factor Model**:  
- Mixtures of PPCA **parameterize covariance matrices as low-rank plus noise**.  
- PCEM-GMM **constructs principal components iteratively**, without relying on an explicit factor loading model.  

‚úÖ **Avoidance of Explicit Matrix Multiplications**:  
- Mixtures of PPCA still **store and compute structured covariance matrices** using \( W_k W_k^T \).  
- PCEM-GMM **never constructs full covariance matrices explicitly**‚Äîit iteratively extracts eigenvectors from the data.  

‚úÖ **More Adaptive Eigenvector Learning**:  
- Mixtures of PPCA **estimate the full subspace for each component in one go**.  
- PCEM-GMM **extracts one principal direction at a time**, dynamically adjusting covariance structure as learning progresses.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
**Mixtures of PPCA and PCEM-GMM both avoid full covariance estimation, but PPCA explicitly models covariance as a factorized matrix, while PCEM-GMM extracts variance directions iteratively.** PCEM-GMM‚Äôs iterative approach might be more robust in cases where covariance structures evolve dynamically.

## **3. Comparison with Low-Rank GMM Variants (e.g., HDDC, Low-Rank GMMs)**
Low-rank GMMs and **high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC)** methods estimate **structured covariance matrices** in a **low-dimensional space per component**.  
- Bouveyron et al. (2007) proposed **HDDC**, which estimates a **cluster-specific subspace** for each Gaussian and **models covariance in that subspace**.  
- Magdon-Ismail and Purnell (2009) introduced **low-rank plus diagonal covariance models**, avoiding full covariance estimation.  

### **How PCEM-GMM Differs from HDDC & Low-Rank GMMs**
‚úÖ **No Assumption of Fixed Subspace Per Component**:  
- HDDC and Low-Rank GMMs **learn a static subspace per cluster**.  
- PCEM-GMM **adjusts the covariance structure dynamically** by iteratively extracting variance directions.  

‚úÖ **No Explicit Low-Rank Matrix Computation**:  
- HDDC and related methods **compute and store reduced covariance matrices**.  
- PCEM-GMM **never forms a covariance matrix explicitly**, only using principal components for responsibilities.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
**HDDC and other low-rank GMMs assume that each cluster has a fixed subspace, whereas PCEM-GMM continuously refines the covariance representation as learning progresses.** This makes PCEM-GMM more flexible in nonstationary or evolving data distributions.

---

## **4. Comparison with Expectation-Maximization for PCA (EM-PCA) (Roweis, 1998)**
Roweis proposed **EM for PCA**, which extracts eigenvectors iteratively using an **expectation-maximization framework**.  
- This algorithm **performs PCA using EM** instead of computing SVD directly.  
- It finds principal components **without computing the full covariance matrix**, making it scalable to large datasets.  

### **How PCEM-GMM Differs from EM-PCA**
‚úÖ **Works in a GMM Framework**:  
- EM-PCA extracts principal components **for a single dataset**.  
- PCEM-GMM applies iterative PCA **to each Gaussian component separately**.  

‚úÖ **Clusters and Extracts Variance Directions Simultaneously**:  
- EM-PCA **only performs dimensionality reduction**.  
- PCEM-GMM **simultaneously clusters and learns variance structures** per component.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
**EM-PCA and PCEM-GMM both iteratively extract eigenvectors, but EM-PCA is designed for a single dataset, while PCEM-GMM embeds the process within a mixture model.** PCEM-GMM can be seen as a natural extension of EM-PCA to probabilistic clustering.

**Conclusion:**  
- **PCEM-GMM is closest to PCA-GMM but differs in that it learns principal components dynamically rather than fixing a projection.**
- **PCEM-GMM also shares ideas with Mixtures of PPCA but avoids explicit factorized covariance matrices.**
- **Unlike HDDC and other low-rank GMMs, PCEM-GMM continuously updates covariance structure rather than assuming a fixed low-rank form.**
- **PCEM-GMM can be seen as an extension of EM-PCA to mixture models.**

üöÄ **Bottom line:** The core **idea of iteratively extracting principal components within EM is not new**, but PCEM-GMM‚Äôs **combination of iterative PCA with dynamic covariance learning in GMMs** seems to be a unique formulation.
