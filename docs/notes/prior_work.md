## Foundational Low-Rank GMM Approaches and Structured Covariance Models  
Early work recognized that **Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)** could be made more tractable by constraining covariance matrices to lie in a lower-dimensional subspace. In the 1990s, researchers introduced *mixture models that perform simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction*. Notably, **mixtures of factor analyzers** (Ghahramani & Hinton, 1996) modeled each cluster’s covariance through a few latent factors instead of a full matrix. This “reduced-dimension mixture of Gaussians” allowed different components to have their own local factor model, effectively capturing the covariance structure with far fewer parameters ([ Abstract:  The EM Algorithm for Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tr96-1.html#:~:text=,)). A closely related model is the **mixture of probabilistic PCA (PPCA)**, proposed by Tipping & Bishop (1999), in which each Gaussian component is restricted to a principal subspace with an isotropic noise term. This PPCA mixture provides “a way to control the number of parameters when estimating covariance structures in high dimensions,” avoiding the need to estimate a full $d \times d$ covariance for each cluster ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=A%20second%20perspective%20is%20that,covariance%20structures%20in%20high%20dimensions)). Both the factor analyzer mixture and PPCA mixture were fit via the EM algorithm, treating the low-dimensional latent projections as hidden variables. These models essentially replace full covariance estimation with **structured covariance** parameterizations – each Gaussian’s covariance is approximated by a low-rank form (plus possibly a diagonal noise), dramatically reducing complexity while still modeling correlations ([[1507.02801] Adaptive Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02801#:~:text=,algorithms%20on%20a%20number%20of)) ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=A%20second%20perspective%20is%20that,covariance%20structures%20in%20high%20dimensions)). Such approaches are **foundational** in combining probabilistic PCA with GMMs, showing that GMM clustering can be done in a latent subspace per component. 

Statistical literature of the 1980s also laid groundwork for structured covariance in multi-group settings. For example, Flury’s **“common principal components”** model (1987) assumed multiple Gaussian classes share a common set of eigenvectors (principal components) with different eigenvalues – a covariance structure constraint that reduces parameters. Likewise, Rubin and Thayer (1982) introduced an EM algorithm for **factor analysis**, demonstrating how maximum-likelihood estimation of a single Gaussian’s low-rank covariance (via latent factors) could be done iteratively without ever computing the full covariance matrix. These ideas foreshadowed the later mixture-of-factor-analyzer models by highlighting that one can fit high-dimensional covariance models by focusing on a few principal components and avoiding direct full-matrix estimation. In summary, **foundational work in ML and statistics established that “reduced-dimension” Gaussian mixtures – using factor analyzers or PCA within each component – are a powerful way to perform clustering with embedded dimensionality reduction ([ Abstract:  The EM Algorithm for Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tr96-1.html#:~:text=,)) ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=A%20second%20perspective%20is%20that,covariance%20structures%20in%20high%20dimensions)). This directly aligns with the spirit of *PCEM-GMM*, replacing explicit covariance calculations with principal-component-based representations.

## EM with Iterative Principal Component Extraction  
A key insight behind these low-rank GMMs is that the **EM algorithm can be leveraged to iteratively extract principal components** as part of parameter estimation. In fact, there is a rich literature on using EM for PCA itself. Roweis (1998) presented an EM algorithm for PCA that “allows a few eigenvectors and eigenvalues to be extracted from large collections of high-dimensional data” efficiently ([EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1398-em-algorithms-for-pca-and-spca.pdf#:~:text=I%20present%20an%20expectation,on%20synthetic%20and%20real%20data)). His algorithm treats the principal axes as parameters to estimate, and by introducing latent variables representing projections onto these axes, EM can find the leading eigenvectors **without ever computing the full covariance matrix**. As Roweis notes, computing the sample covariance in $d$ dimensions costs $O(nd^2)$ and eigen-decomposition costs $O(d^3)$, which is prohibitive for large $d$; the EM-PCA method instead only requires $O(n d \cdot k)$ per iteration (if $k$ principal components are sought) ([EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1398-em-algorithms-for-pca-and-spca.pdf#:~:text=One%20is%20that%20naive%20methods,covariance%20itself%20is%20very%20costly)) ([EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1398-em-algorithms-for-pca-and-spca.pdf#:~:text=requiring%200%20%28np2%29%20operations,direct%20diagonalization%20of%20a%20symmetric)). This was a breakthrough in showing that **iterative EM steps could replace direct SVD/PCA computations** by treating principal component estimation as an inference problem with latent factors. Tipping and Bishop’s work on **probabilistic PCA** (1999) similarly derived an EM procedure to estimate the principal subspace iteratively ([Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/seminar/2020-representation/readings/TippingBishop1999.pdf#:~:text=analysis,this%20probabilistic%20approach%20to%20PCA)). They highlight that a PPCA model leads naturally to an EM algorithm for finding the principal axes of data in a maximum-likelihood framework ([Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/seminar/2020-representation/readings/TippingBishop1999.pdf#:~:text=analysis,this%20probabilistic%20approach%20to%20PCA)). In both cases, the EM updates effectively perform a form of **iterative eigenvector extraction**: the E-step computes expectations of latent coordinates (projecting data onto the current estimate of the subspace), and the M-step updates the subspace (e.g. the factor loading matrix) to best explain the data ([EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1398-em-algorithms-for-pca-and-spca.pdf#:~:text=I%20present%20an%20expectation,and%20efficiently%20find%20the%20lead%02ing)) ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=to%20mixture%20models%20in%20Section,The%20partitioning)). 

Within mixture models, these ideas carry over to each component. The **mixture of PPCA** is explicitly described as having an “efficient EM algorithm for estimating all of the model parameters” ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=to%20mixture%20models%20in%20Section,The%20partitioning)), meaning that for each component, the M-step involves finding the principal-component subspace that maximizes that cluster’s likelihood (often solvable by a smaller eigen-decomposition or closed-form update thanks to the low-dimensional structure). In essence, **EM is used to perform local PCA inside each cluster update**. This approach sidesteps computing or inverting large covariance matrices for each component – instead, one solves for a limited number of principal directions per cluster. The literature even refers to this as concurrently doing clustering and “locally linear dimensionality reduction” ([ Abstract:  The EM Algorithm for Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tr96-1.html#:~:text=,)). Thus, any method like *PCEM-GMM* – where covariance estimation is replaced by iterative PCA extraction – is grounded in these earlier techniques. The *iterative principal component extraction within EM* was well-established by the late 90s: for a single Gaussian (PCA/FA) and extended to Gaussian mixtures (mixtures of PCA/FA). In summary, academic work has long described how one can embed PCA computation inside the EM loop to yield low-rank covariance estimates, providing the blueprint for a PCEM-GMM approach ([EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1398-em-algorithms-for-pca-and-spca.pdf#:~:text=I%20present%20an%20expectation,and%20efficiently%20find%20the%20lead%02ing)) ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=to%20mixture%20models%20in%20Section,The%20partitioning)).

## Recent Developments in Low-Rank GMMs (Last 5–10 Years)  
In the past decade, there’s been a renewed interest in GMM variants that avoid full covariance estimation, often due to the challenges of high-dimensional data. For example, Hertrich et al. (2021) introduced **PCA-GMM**, a Gaussian mixture model that explicitly incorporates a PCA dimensionality reduction within each component ([[2009.07520] PCA Reduced Gaussian Mixture Models with Applications in Superresolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07520#:~:text=propose%20a%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Model,on%20the%20overall%20superresolution%20result)). Their approach retains only a component-specific principal subspace (of chosen rank) and was learned by an EM algorithm where the M-step solves a constrained optimization to update the subspace basis ([[2009.07520] PCA Reduced Gaussian Mixture Models with Applications in Superresolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07520#:~:text=propose%20a%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Model,on%20the%20overall%20superresolution%20result)). This is essentially the same philosophy as PCEM-GMM – each M-step finds principal directions instead of calculating a dense covariance. They report that this method can handle very high-dimensional image data with only a “moderate influence of the dimensionality reduction on the overall result,” demonstrating efficiency without much loss in accuracy ([[2009.07520] PCA Reduced Gaussian Mixture Models with Applications in Superresolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07520#:~:text=propose%20a%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Model,on%20the%20overall%20superresolution%20result)). Another notable work is by Kaya and Salah (2015), who proposed an **adaptive mixture of factor analyzers**. Their algorithm performs **“simultaneous clustering and locally linear, globally nonlinear dimensionality reduction,”** even allowing different numbers of factors (principal components) per component ([[1507.02801] Adaptive Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02801#:~:text=,algorithms%20on%20a%20number%20of)). This flexibility lets the EM training automatically determine the appropriate subspace dimensionality for each Gaussian, effectively **embedding an iterative PCA selection inside each component’s update**. Such advances build on the classic mixture-of-FA framework but focus on model selection and scalability for modern datasets. 

We also see structured covariance GMMs appearing in specialized domains and theoretical studies. Magdon-Ismail and Purnell (2009) formulated a **Low-Rank GMM** with covariance matrices modeled as “diagonal plus low-rank” perturbations ([prop.dvi](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~magdon/ps/journal/LowRank_IJDMM.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Covariance%20matrices%20capture%20correlations,The%20curse%20of%20dimensionality%20that)) ([prop.dvi](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~magdon/ps/journal/LowRank_IJDMM.pdf#:~:text=arises%20in%20calculating%20the%20covariance,M%20Biographical%20notes)), achieving nearly the computational cost of diagonal covariance while capturing correlations. In high-dimensional clustering applications, methods like **High-Dimensional Data Clustering (HDDC)** by Bouveyron et al. (2007) estimate a specific subspace and intrinsic dimension for each cluster via EM ([[math/0604064] High-Dimensional Data Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604064#:~:text=is%20recurrent%20in%20many%20domains%2C,real%20datasets%20show%20that%20HDDC)) ([[math/0604064] High-Dimensional Data Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604064#:~:text=ideas%20of%20dimension%20reduction%20and,dimensional%20data)) – again a close analogue to performing PCA inside the mixture model. Even if not always phrased as “iterative principal component extraction,” the common theme is **replacing full covariance estimation with principled low-rank approximations learned iteratively**. This trend has appeared at venues like AISTATS and in journals: for instance, recent work in *Inverse Problems & Imaging* explicitly combines GMMs with PCA-based compression ([[2009.07520] PCA Reduced Gaussian Mixture Models with Applications in Superresolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07520#:~:text=propose%20a%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Model,on%20the%20overall%20superresolution%20result)), and adaptive factor analyzer mixtures have been discussed in ML preprints and toolkits ([[1507.02801] Adaptive Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02801#:~:text=,algorithms%20on%20a%20number%20of)). 

**Bottom line:** The approach embodied by *PCEM-GMM* – integrating principal component analysis into the EM updates of a GMM – has clear precedents in both classic and recent research. Foundational models like mixtures of factor analyzers/PPCA **concurrently perform clustering and dimensionality reduction** ([ Abstract:  The EM Algorithm for Mixtures of Factor Analyzers](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tr96-1.html#:~:text=,)), using EM to find low-rank covariances instead of full matrices. In the last 5–10 years, researchers have revisited these ideas to tackle contemporary high-dimensional problems, confirming that the essence of PCEM-GMM has been described before in various forms. The literature consistently shows that iterative PCA within EM is a viable strategy to simplify covariance estimation in mixture models while retaining modeling power ([](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf#:~:text=A%20second%20perspective%20is%20that,covariance%20structures%20in%20high%20dimensions)) ([[2009.07520] PCA Reduced Gaussian Mixture Models with Applications in Superresolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07520#:~:text=propose%20a%20Gaussian%20Mixture%20Model,on%20the%20overall%20superresolution%20result)).
